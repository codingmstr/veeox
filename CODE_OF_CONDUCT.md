follows the **Rust Code of Conduct**.

This describes the minimum behavior expected from all contributors and community members across
Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, and other project spaces.

We will investigate reports and take appropriate action, including moderating content and
restricting participation when necessary.

- Sexualized language or unwelcome sexual attention
- Deliberate disruption, intimidation, or doxxing
