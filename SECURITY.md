# Report a security issue

The veeox project team welcomes security reports and is committed to giving prompt attention to
security issues.

Security issues should be reported privately. Please **do not** report them via public GitHub
Issues.

## How to report

Preferred: use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting / Security Advisories** on the repository
(if enabled). Otherwise, contact the project maintainer(s) privately using the contact method on
their GitHub profile.

## Vulnerability coordination

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized by the project maintainers. When applicable,
coordination will be done using GitHub Security Advisories.

## Security advisories

When a security issue is confirmed and fixed, we aim for a transparent disclosure process.
Announcements may be made via GitHub Releases and, when appropriate, the RustSec advisory database.
