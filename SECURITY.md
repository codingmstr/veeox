# Security Policy

The Veeox project team welcomes security reports and will prioritize fixes for confirmed issues.
Please report security issues **privately** and **do not** open public GitHub Issues.

## How to report

Preferred: use GitHub **Security Advisories / Private Vulnerability Reporting** for this repository.

If advisories are not available, contact the maintainer(s) privately via the contact method on their
GitHub profile.

## What to include

To help us triage quickly, include:

- Affected crate(s) and version(s)
- Impact and severity (what can an attacker do?)
- Minimal reproduction / PoC (if possible)
- Steps to reproduce + environment details
- Any relevant logs or error output

**Do not include secrets** (tokens, private keys, credentials) in reports or logs.

## Coordinated disclosure

We prefer coordinated disclosure. Please avoid public disclosure until a fix is available.

## Advisories

When a security issue is confirmed and fixed, we aim for transparent disclosure via GitHub Releases
and, when appropriate, RustSec.
