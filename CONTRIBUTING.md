## What makes a great contribution

- Small and focused: one logical change per PR when possible.
- Verified: tests updated (or a clear explanation why not).
- Clear: describe the why, not just the what.
- Documented: if behavior/API changes, update docs/examples.

If you are unsure about scope, start with a short discussion first: **DISCUSSIONS_URL**
