## Expectations

We are community-driven.

- **Bugs:** regressions and blockers get priority (include a minimal repro).
- **Features:** discuss first in Discussions.
- **Response:** clear reports + logs/versions = faster answers.

## What we can (and can’t) do

- ✅ Best support: latest stable release + reproducible reports.
- ❌ Hard to help: “it’s broken” with no repro/logs, unsupported forks/versions.
