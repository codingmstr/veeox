## Before you open an issue

We value your time and ours. To get a fast answer, please:

1. **Run the Doctor:**

   ```bash
   vx doctor
   ```

Paste the relevant output (and **redact tokens/secrets** if any).

2. **Isolate the problem:** Provide a minimal reproduction (snippet or repo link). “It crashes” is
   not debuggable; “It crashes when I run X with Y config” is.

## Expectations

**Veeox** is community-driven.

- **Bugs:** regressions and blockers get priority.
- **Features:** discuss first in Discussions.
- **Response:** high-quality reports (with repro + `vx doctor`) get faster responses.
